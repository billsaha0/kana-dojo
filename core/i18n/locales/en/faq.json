      "q1": {
        "question": "What is KanaDojo?",
        "answer": "KanaDojo is a free Japanese learning platform for practicing Hiragana, Katakana, Kanji, and vocabulary with fast drills and game-like training modes. It’s designed for self-study, quick feedback, and steady progress."
      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "Is KanaDojo really free?",
        "answer": "Yes. KanaDojo is free to use with no required account and no paywalled practice content."
      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "Do I need to create an account?",
        "answer": "No. Your preferences and learning stats are stored locally in your browser. If you clear site data or switch devices/browsers, your local progress won’t automatically follow."

      "q1": {
        "question": "Should I learn Hiragana or Katakana first?",
        "answer": "Most learners start with Hiragana, then move to Katakana. Once you can read kana comfortably, start beginner Kanji and vocabulary together for faster real-world comprehension."
      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "How long does it take to learn Hiragana and Katakana?",
        "answer": "With consistent daily practice, many learners memorize each kana set in 1–2 weeks and become comfortable reading within a month. Speed and accuracy improve with short, frequent sessions."
      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "When should I start Kanji?",
        "answer": "After you know kana well enough to read basic words (even slowly), start Kanji—ideally by JLPT level (N5 → N4 → N3 → N2 → N1). Learning Kanji alongside vocabulary helps retention."

      "q1": {
        "question": "What are the training modes?",
        "answer": "KanaDojo includes recognition and recall modes (pick/reverse-pick, input/reverse-input) plus speed challenges like Blitz and longer mastery checks like Gauntlet. Switch modes depending on whether you want accuracy, recall, or speed."
      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "What’s the best mode for beginners?",
        "answer": "Start with recognition (pick mode) to build fast pattern matching, then add input mode for recall. For kana, alternating recognition and typing is a strong combo."
      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "Can I customize themes and fonts?",
        "answer": "Yes. KanaDojo supports extensive customization (themes, fonts, and preferences) so you can find a look that’s comfortable for long study sessions."

        "answer": "Your progress is saved locally in your browser (on your device). This keeps your stats private and lets you start instantly without signup."
      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "Will my progress sync across devices?",
        "answer": "Not automatically. Because progress is stored locally, switching browsers/devices won’t carry progress unless you manually move data."
      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "Does KanaDojo work offline?",
        "answer": "KanaDojo can work offline for core practice once assets are cached, but the best experience is with an internet connection—especially the first load."

      "q1": {
        "question": "Does KanaDojo help with JLPT?",
        "answer": "Yes. KanaDojo organizes Kanji and vocabulary by JLPT level (N5–N1), which makes it easy to focus your practice for a target exam level."
      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "Is KanaDojo enough to pass JLPT?",
        "answer": "It’s a strong practice tool for recognition, recall, and speed—but JLPT also tests listening, reading comprehension, and grammar in context. Pair KanaDojo with graded reading/listening and a grammar resource."
      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "What should I study for JLPT N5 first?",
        "answer": "Start with Hiragana + Katakana, then N5 Kanji and core vocabulary. Short daily sessions beat occasional cramming—aim for consistency and review your weak items often."

      "q1": {
        "question": "I keep mixing up similar characters. What should I do?",
        "answer": "Reduce your active set, drill recognition first, and add short recall sessions. For kana, practice minimal pairs and focus on the distinguishing strokes (e.g., さ vs ち, シ vs ツ)."
      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "My accuracy is fine but I’m slow.",
        "answer": "Add timed practice (Blitz) with a small set. Speed usually improves after accuracy becomes stable."
      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "My progress looks reset. Did I lose everything?",
        "answer": "Progress is stored locally. Clearing browser data, using incognito mode, or switching devices/browsers can make it look reset. Check you’re in the same browser profile and that site data isn’t being cleared automatically."
